# Quarantine-Tracker
A POC app that requires those in quarantine to take a selfie of themselves every hour.
The concept was for the app to prompt the user to take a picture of themself every few hours or so, with a geotag.
Front-End: React Native
Backend: flask, facelib for image processing
The project was never finished.
